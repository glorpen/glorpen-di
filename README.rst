================
GlorpenLibs: DIC
================

Another Dependency Injection library for Python.

This package is following three guidelines:

- any class configured by DI mechanism should not be modified in any way
- there should be no external services definition files for DI
- no DI "compiling" - Python is dynamic languge and it should stay that way
